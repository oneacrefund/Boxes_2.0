Boxes -- One Acre Fund's geospatial repository.

This git repository hosts code for Boxes, a geospatial mapping tool that lets a user visualize up to 17 raster datasets for 41 countries in Sub-Saharan Africa. The map can either be in  'boxes' format, or admin-based mapping. The former paints raster grids ('boxes') based on the user's data and filter criteria, while the latter summarizes raster data for 'boxes' that fall within admin boundaries for a selected country (e.g. for each county in Kenya).

The app has a fairly large amount of data; if you'd like access to the data, don't hesitate to ask Bernard (bernard.kiprop@oneacrefund.org). The app will finally be available online on Shinyapps and we'll include a link to it here.

The main scripts are the global.R, UI.R and Server.R scripts.

If you'd like to see earlier (code) versions of the app, go to https://github.com/bkiprop15/Boxes_2.0
